###Smart Parking Management System

Our project aims to create an efficient, affordable, and automated parking management system that addresses urban parking challenges, reduces congestion, and enhances user experience. Utilizing advanced technologies such as IoT, AI, and real-time data analytics, our system will monitor parking space availability, streamline the booking process, and improve the overall parking experienceâ€”all at a lower cost for users.

Key features of the Smart Parking Management System include:

1. Real-Time Parking Availability: Using sensors and IoT, the system will monitor and provide up-to-date information on available parking spots, allowing drivers to find parking quickly.


2. Automated Booking and Payments: With a user-friendly app, drivers can reserve parking spaces, pay electronically, and receive digitalin  confirmations, making the process seamless and cost-effective.


3. Lower Pricing Options: Our system provides lower parking rates through efficient resource management, ensuring that users can find affordable parking without compromising on convenience or accessibility.


4. Data Analytics for Optimal Usage: The system will collect data to analyze peak times, usage patterns, and parking demand, helping optimize space allocation and manage traffic flow effectively.


5. Smart Alerts and Notifications: Users will receive notifications on their mobile devices for real-time updates on parking availability, expiration alerts, and navigation to the nearest parking spot.


6. Environmentally Friendly Solution: By reducing idle time spent searching for parking, the system helps decrease fuel consumption and lowers carbon emissions.



File also contain demand prediction models for H.A Baku International Airport(holidays,weekends, COP29 etc.).



Our Smart Parking Management System is designed to alleviate urban parking issues, enhance convenience, and provide a cost-effective solution for drivers, all while promoting a sustainable approach to city parking management.
